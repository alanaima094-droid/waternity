## Dependencies & Critical Path

### Critical Dependencies:
1. **Database Schema** → All data-dependent features
2. **State Management** → All interactive features
3. **API Foundation** → All backend integrations
4. **Hedera Setup** → All blockchain features

### Parallel Development Tracks:
- **Frontend Track**: Landing → Dashboard → Components
- **Backend Track**: API → Database → Blockchain
- **Integration Track**: State Management → Testing → Deployment

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
- **Hedera Integration Complexity**: Start early, create POC
- **Performance with Real-time Data**: Implement caching strategy
- **Scalability**: Design with horizontal scaling in mind

### Timeline Risks:
- **Feature Creep**: Stick to MVP for v3.0
- **Integration Delays**: Parallel development where possible
- **Testing Bottlenecks**: Continuous testing approach

## Success Metrics

### Technical KPIs:
- Page load time < 2s
- Test coverage > 80%
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- 99.9% uptime

### Business KPIs:
- User registration flow completion > 80%
- Investment flow completion > 70%
- Proof submission success rate > 95%
- Platform transaction volume growth

## Next Immediate Actions:
